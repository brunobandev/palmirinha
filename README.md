# Consagrado Bot

***Problem:***

Working at a startup, almost every day, we asked for food delivery. But the team grew too fast, and it became a **HUGE** mess to take all orders manually.

***Solution:***

Our main communication channel between the company's areas was Discord. So, why not create a bot to organize orders? And here we are!

***But why Consagrado?***

This project was born in *Brazil*, and there Consagrado is a "*loving*" way to call the waiter. heart

**The project is being organized to accept new changes. Follow!**
